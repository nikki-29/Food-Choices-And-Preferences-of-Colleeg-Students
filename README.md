# Food-Choices-And-Preferences-of-College-Students

## Problem statement

Analysing the food choices and preferences of college going students and how various factors such as their GPA, childhood favourite foods, employment statuses of 
parents etc., affect these preferences.  EDA is performed to identify the patterns in the datset. Analysis is done using correlation and Logistic Regression. 

## Overview

Food is one of the most important sustaining factors for humans. There are various studies that have shown that a balanced diet in students, helps improve their focus,
keeps them energised and helps them perform better in school. This project tries to analyse the food choices and preferences of college going students and how various
factors such as their GPA, childhood favourite foods, employment statuses of parents etc., affect these preferences. A group of Mercyhurst University students(n=126) 
participated in the survey about their nutrition choices and food preferences and this data was collected from Kaggle. R and Python programming languages were used to
carry out exploratory data analysis. R was specifically used to fit a logistic regression model to check the dependence of whether or not a student will participate 
actively in sports activities, given their gender and whether or not they consumed vitamins.

## Objective

The aim of this project is to understand the food consumption patterns in college going students and identify how these patterns are influenced by various relevant
factors such as the type of food they consumed growing up, their employment status, their income, their awareness about calories presents in various foods etc. By 
undertaking this study, one attempts to provide significant insights about these patterns and pave way for measures that can be taken to promote healthier alternatives 
among young adults.
